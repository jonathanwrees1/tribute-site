        <h3 id="tribute-headline">Timeline of Louis Pasteur's Life</h3>

        <ul id="timeline">
          <li><strong>1822</strong>-Born in Dole, Jura, France</li>
          <li><strong>1831</strong>-Pasteur entered primary school</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1839</strong>-He entered the Collège Royal at Besançon to
            study philosophy
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1846</strong>-Appointed professor of physics at the Collège
            de Tournon
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1848</strong>-Became professor of chemistry at the
            University of Strasbourg
          </li>
          <li><strong>1849</strong>-Married Marie Laurent</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1854</strong>-Named dean of the new faculty of sciences at
            University of Lille, where he began his studies on fermentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1857 </strong>-Pasteur sent a paper about lactic acid
            fermentation to the Société des Sciences de Lille
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1861</strong>-He observed that less sugar fermented per part
            of yeast when the yeast was exposed to air. The lower rate of
            fermentation aerobically became known as the Pasteur effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1865</strong>-Pasteur's research also showed that the growth
            of micro-organisms was responsible for spoiling beverages, such as
            beer, wine and milk. He invented a process in which liquids such as
            milk were heated to a temperature between 60 and 100 °C. This killed
            most bacteria and moulds already present within them. The method
            became known as pasteurization
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1885</strong>-Invented the rabies vaccine which proved to be
            highly effective
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1895</strong>-Died at the age of 72 most likely due to a
            stroke.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p id="final-words">
          Louis Pasteur's research in chemistry led to remarkable breakthroughs
          in the understanding of the causes and preventions of diseases, which
          laid down the foundations of hygiene, public health and much of modern
          medicine. His works are credited to saving millions of lives through
          the developments of vaccines.
